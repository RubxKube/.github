# RubxKube

Welcome to RubxKube, a GitHub organization dedicated to hosting Helm charts!

## Introduction

RubxKube is a community-driven organization that aims to continue the legacy of the beloved project, k8s-at-home. Inspired by the vision and contributions of the k8s-at-home community, RubxKube was created to provide a new home for Helm charts and support the deployment of applications on Kubernetes.

## Repository

This organization hosts the following repositories:

- [rubxkube-charts](https://github.com/RubxKube/charts): This repository contains a collection of Helm charts maintained by the RubxKube community. Each chart is designed to package, deploy, and manage a specific application or service on Kubernetes using Helm, the package manager for Kubernetes.
- [common-charts](https://github.com/RubxKube/common-charts): This repository contains a set of common templates that can be used across different projects and deployments. These templates provide reusable configurations, best practices, and guidelines for various Kubernetes resources
